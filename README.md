# Practicum by Yandex - Project 2
## Advanced HTML & CSS
------
A project created for the Web Development course at Yandex Practicum. The project is for the second Advanced HTML & CSS sprint that involves creating a single page webpage with varying sections and elements. The content includes various information and images related to learning and education.

The project is structured and named using BEM methodologies. Technologies used include: animations, transitions,  iframes, Youtube API, and basic CSS.

Plans for finalizing the project includes ensuring cross-compatibility with popular browsers used, ensuring the webpage works on other devices such as mobile by adding media queries, including forms to contact and subsequent php for data collection, and further stylizing and content modifications.
